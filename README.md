# Omni-WheelCAD

This repo contains SolidWorks CAD files and exported STL models for custom omniwheels designed to fit **N20 DC gear motors**.  
The goal of this project was to practice CAD and prototyping while creating a cost-effective alternative to commercial omniwheels, which are often oversized and expensive.
